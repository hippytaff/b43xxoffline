#EXAMPLE
#Create script to download bcmwl-kernel-source packages/debs
mkdir bcmwl-kernel-source
cd bcmwl-kernel-source
apt-get -qq --print-uris install bcmwl-kernel-source > bcmwl-kernel-source
awk '{gsub("\x27", "", $0); print $1}' < bcmwl-kernel-source > bcmwl-kernel-source.sh
wget -i bcmwl-kernel-source.sh

#Copy the current apt sources so they can later be unziped onto the system you are installing on. Use makeself to build
#executable file
cp -r /var/lib/apt/lists .
cd ..
makeself --nox11 --bzip2 /home/bodhi/liferea liferea.bod "Liferea RSS Reader" ./installer

This should create a bcmwl-kernel-source.bod file in whatever directory it is executed in.
