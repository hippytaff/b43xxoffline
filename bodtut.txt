mkdir liferea
cd liferea/
apt-get -qq --print-uris install liferea > liferea
awk '{gsub("\x27", "", $0); print $1}' < liferea > liferea.sh
wget -i liferea.sh

We also need to copy the current apt sources so they can later be unziped onto the system you are installing on.

cp -r /var/lib/apt/lists .
cd ..
makeself --nox11 --bzip2 /home/bodhi/liferea liferea.bod "Liferea RSS Reader" ./installer

This should create a liferea.bod file in whatever directory you execute it in.

If you want to use the installer script for another application and don't fancy manually changing the words liferea to whatever application you want to .bod then you can do
sed -i 's/liferea/appname/gI' installer
